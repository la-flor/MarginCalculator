# Margin Calculator

This calculator is a publically available Google Chrome Extension available on the Chrome Web Store labeled as **Margin Calculator** under the ***Productivity*** category.  I created this for, and it is used by CompetitiveCyclist and Backcountry employees to help calculate the ability to discount merchandise items for customers to increase sales and maintain good relationships with customers.

Calculate the profit margin for a product by entering the item cost
This business and sales tool is useful for determining ability to discount items for customers and determining profitability from possible sales.  Calculate the sale price at different profit margins for a product by entering the cost at which the item is purchased at.  

This product is a simplistic tool and does not take into account other business expenses, but future updates might include additional features such as this.

Example:
A product purchased at $19.99 cost would provide a 30 point margin if sold at $28.56 or a 32 point margin if sold at $29.40.


# Future Thoughts:
Possible implimentation of a normal calulator as an additional tab for when regular calculations are needed.

Possible implimentation of a reactive number under "Suggested Price" for easy Copy/Paste actions for the user.
